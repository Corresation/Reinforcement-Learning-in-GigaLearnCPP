Reinforcement Learning in GigaLearnCPP
--------------------------------------

This repository explores Reinforcement Learning using the GigaLearnCPP framework.
The main goal of this project is to test as much as possible with the framework and
experiment with additional features.

This work is purely experimental and focuses on testing the framework itself rather than
achieving competitive results. All code, results, and configurations are part of
a personal research effort to understand PPO behavior, reward shaping, and general
learning patterns in this environment alone.

Everything here is written in C++ using the GigaLearnCPP and RLGymPPO libraries.
It is primarily intended for exploratory use.

No results are published here yet. This repository currently serves as
a foundation and reference for further reinforcement learning research using
the GigaLearnCPP framework.
