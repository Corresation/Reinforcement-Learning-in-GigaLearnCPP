  <h2 style="color:#6bd26b;">Overview</h2>
  <p style="line-height:1.6;">
    Siege is my personal (and experimental) Rocket League bot built using GigaLearnCPP.<br>
    It is my project focusing on making a successful bot in 1v1s, 2v2s and 3v3s. The end goal is to make a bot that can beat GCs in all modes!

  <h2 style="color:#6bd26b;">What is the purpose of Siege?</h2>
  <p style="line-height:1.6;">
    The purpose of Siege is to experiment with my first genuine Rocket League bot using this framework.<br>
    It acts as a run to document what works and what doesn't work.<br>
    No population based training, IDMs, BCMs etc — Siege learns with experience & PPO!
  </p>

  <p style="line-height:1.6;">
    Over time, Siege will be used to create a bot with a wider brain, meaning it has the capacity to perform more than this model.<br>
    It’s meant to answer one question clearly:<br>
    <span style="display:block; margin-top:10px; font-style:italic; color:#76c7ff;">
      "How far can this base agent get with these limitations?"
    </span>
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:#6bd26b;">Development Plans & Intentions</h2>
  <p style="line-height:1.6;">
    Training began with nothing more than basic rewards and minimal necessities.<br>
    Siege has ~3 million parameters total, and is being taught to learn ground play as best as possible.<br>
    Early stages focus on team ability and consistency with fundementals.<br>
    The design is intentionally minimal to observe each improvement as it happens.
  </p>

  <p style="line-height:1.6;">
    Siege will eventually become my reference bot for creating better bots, and those future bots will follow the same pattern.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:#6bd26b;">Will this be used and expanded upon?</h2>
  <p style="line-height:1.6;">
    Yes, absolutely!<br>
    The initial version of Siege is purely experimental, and attempts to maximize its ability will use the basics as best as possible.<br>
    Once the base version is done, I will transfer learn this onto bigger parameters to learn more, and it will continue to aim higher.
